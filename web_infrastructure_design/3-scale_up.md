# Task 3: Scale Up Infrastructure

## Additional Elements and Why We Added Them

### 1. Second Load Balancer (HAproxy #2)
Eliminates single point of failure at entry point. If Load Balancer #1 fails, Load Balancer #2 automatically takes over using clustering technology, ensuring website stays online during maintenance or failures.

### 2. Dedicated Web Server
Specializes only in handling HTTP requests and serving static content. Better performance than mixed servers, easier to scale web capacity independently, and optimized hardware/configuration for web serving tasks.

### 3. Dedicated Application Server  
Specializes only in executing business logic and code processing. Can scale processing power independently, optimized for CPU-intensive tasks, and separates concerns for easier maintenance and troubleshooting.

### 4. Separated Database Servers
Database servers focus only on data storage and queries. Can optimize hardware for database performance. Easier to implement database-specific security measures and can scale database independently.

## Infrastructure Benefits

### Component Separation Advantages
- **Better Performance:** Each server optimized for specific job
- **Easier Scaling:** Add only the tier you need more of (web, app, or database)
- **Simpler Management:** Specialists are easier to configure and maintain
- **Better Security:** Fewer services per server reduces attack surface
- **Focused Updates:** Update just web servers or just databases without affecting other components

### High Availability Improvements
- **Load Balancer Clustering:** No single point of failure at entry point
- **Automatic Failover:** Services continue running if one component fails
- **Maintenance Capability:** Can update components without full downtime

### Scalability Improvements
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Can add more servers of any type as needed
- **Independent Scaling:** Scale web capacity separate from database capacity
- **Resource Optimization:** Right hardware for each job
